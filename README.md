# L1-Norm-Algorithms
The current repository provides the code for the popular L1-norm Priciplal Component Analysis. The original algorithm was developed and published by P. P. Markopoulos, S. Kundu, S. Chamadia and D. A. Pados, "Efficient L1-Norm Principal-Component Analysis via Bit Flipping", in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 65, no. 16, pp. 4252-4264, 15 Aug.15, 2017.

The entry point is the file l1_pca_example.py.

We have tested the code on Python 2.7. The prerequisite packages to run it are: 
- scipy (publicly available from: https://www.scipy.org/install.html)

The prerequisite packages can be installed via pip by: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

List of files included: l1_pca_example.py, l1pca_sbfk_v0.py
